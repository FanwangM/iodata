Installation
============

Stable releases
---------------

.. warning::

    We are preparing a 1.0 release. Until then, these instructions for
    installing a stable release will not work yet. If you enjoy living on the
    edge, try the development release as explained in the
    ":ref:`install-latest-git-revision`" section below.

Python 3 (>=3.6) must be installed before you can install IOData. In addition,
IOData has the following dependencies:

- numpy >= 1.0: https://numpy.org/
- scipy: https://scipy.org/
- attrs >= 20.1.0: https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/index.html
- importlib_resources [only for Python 3.6]: https://gitlab.com/python-devs/importlib_resources

Normally, you don't need to install these dependencies manually. They will be
installed automatically when you follow the instructions below.

Installation with Ana- or Miniconda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install IOData using the conda package management system, install
`miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__ or
`anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`__ first, and then:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Activate your main conda environment if it is not loaded in your .bashrc.
    # E.g. run the following if you have miniconda installed in e.g. ~/miniconda3
    source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate

    # Create a horton3 conda environment. (optional, recommended)
    conda create -n horton3
    source activate horton3

    # Install the stable release.
    conda install -c theochem qc-iodata

    # Unstable releases
    # (Only do this if you understand the implications.)
    # Install the testing release. (beta)
    conda install -c theochem/label/test qc-iodata
    # Install the development release. (alpha)
    conda install -c theochem/label/dev qc-iodata


Installation with Pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. You can work in a `virtual environment`_:

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Create a virtual environment in ~/horton3
       # Feel free to change the path.
       python3 -m venv ~/horton3

       # Activate the virtual environemnt.
       source ~/horton3/bin/activate

       # Install the stable release in the venv horton3.
       pip3 install qc-iodata
       # alternative: python3 -m pip install qc-iodata

       # For developers, install a pre-release (alpha or beta).
       # (Only do this if you understand the implications.)
       pip3 install --pre qc-iodata
       # alternative: python3 -m pip install --pre qc-iodata

2. You can install into your ``${HOME}`` directory, without creating a virtual
   environment.

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Install the stable release in your home directory.
       pip3 install qc-iodata --user
       # alternative: python3 -m pip install qc-iodata --user

       # For developers, install a pre-release (alpha or beta).
       # (Only do this if you understand the implications.)
       pip3 install --pre qc-iodata --user
       # alternative: python3 -m pip install --pre qc-iodata --user

   This is by far the simplest method, ideal to get started, but you have only
   one home directory. If the installation breaks due to some experimentation,
   it is harder to make a clean start in comparison to the other options.

In case the ``pip3`` executable is not found, pip may be installed in a
directory which is not included in your ``${PATH}`` variable. This seems to be a
common issue on macOS. A simple workaround is to replace ``pip3`` by ``python3
-m pip``.

In case Python and your operating system are up to date, you may also use
``pip`` instead of ``pip3`` or ``python`` instead of ``python3``. The ``3`` is
only used to avoid potential confusion with Python 2. Note that the ``3`` is
only present in names of executables, not names of Python modules.


.. _install-latest-git-revision:

Latest git revision
-------------------

This section shows how one can install the latest revision of IOData from the
git repository. This kind of installation comes with some risks (sudden API
changes, bugs, ...) and so be prepared to accept them when using the following
installation instructions.

There are two installation methods:

1. **Quick and dirty.** Of this method, there are four variants, depending on
   the correctness of your ``PATH`` variable and the presence of a virtual or
   conda environment. These different scenarios are explained in more detail in
   the previous section.

   .. code-block:: bash

       # with env, correct PATH
       pip install git+https://github.com/theochem/iodata.git
       # with env, broken PATH
       python -m pip install git+https://github.com/theochem/iodata.git
       # without env, correct PATH
       pip install git+https://github.com/theochem/iodata.git --user
       # without env, broken PATH
       python -m pip install git+https://github.com/theochem/iodata.git --user

2. **Slow and smart.** In addition to the four variations in the quick and dirty
   method, the slow and smart can be used with ``pip`` or just with
   ``setup.py``. You also have the options to use *SSH* or *HTTPS* protocols to
   clone the git repository. Pick whichever works best for you.

   .. code-block:: bash

        # A) Clone git repo with https OR ssh:
        # The second one only works if you have ssh set up for Github
        #  A1) https
        git clone https://github.com/theochem/iodata.git
        #  A2) ssh
        git clone git@github.com:theochem/iodata.git
        # B) Optionally write the version string
        pip install roberto  # or any of the three other ways of running pip, see above.
        rob write-version
        # C) Actual install, 6 different methods.
        #  C1) setup.py, with env
        python setup.py install
        #  C2) pip, with env, correct PATH
        pip install .
        #  C3) pip, with env, broken PATH
        python -m pip install .
        #  C4) setup.py, without env
        python setup.py install --user
        #  C5) pip, without env, correct PATH
        pip install . --user
        #  C6) pip, without env, broken PATH
        python -m pip install . --user


Testing
-------

The tests are automatically run when we build packages with conda, but you may
try them again on your own machine after installation.

With Ana- or Miniconda:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install pytest in your conda env.
    conda install pytest pytest-xdist
    # Then run the tests.
    pytest --pyargs iodata -n auto


With Pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install pytest in your conda env ...
    pip install pytest pytest-xdist
    # .. and refresh the virtual environment.
    # This is a venv quirk. Without it, pytest may not find IOData.
    deactivate && source ~/horton3/activate

    # Alternatively, install pytest in your home directory.
    pip install pytest pytest-xdist --user

    # Finally, run the tests.
    pytest --pyargs iodata -n auto
